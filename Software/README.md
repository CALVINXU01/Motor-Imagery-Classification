# Motor-Imagery-Classification

## Background

According to the World Health Organization report, between 250,000 to 500,000 people suffer from spinal cord injuries each year globally.[1] When patients experience muscle paralysis due to spinal cord injury or damage to motor neurons, it inevitably has a significant impact on their quality of life. By implanting specific photosensitive neurons and stimulating them with precise light pulse signals, there is potential to restore some degree of motor ability in these patients.[2] This project involves the development of a device to collect the patient's EEG signals. These signals are then processed using a motor imagery classifier to discern the patient's intended movements, thereby assisting in sending more accurate light pulse signals to the photosensitive stem cells. Based on the team's research and discussions with the project supervisor, the project has been divided into two main components: hardware and software.
